1. Which are the core data set(s) you plan to study for the project?  Provide URLs.

    Camden Licensing Applications Beta

    https://data.gov.uk/dataset/camden-licensing-applications-beta/resource/34304cd6-4d25-45b7-b932-4fbfac13ea69

2. If you plan to use them, which secondary data set(s) are you considering to use, and why?

    n/a

3. What are the non-trivial temporal aspects of your data?

    Every licensing has an approval as well as an expiration date. A licensing
    is active within this range.  Furthermore there are three more date columns
    which give information about the approval process.

4. Are the data sets you've selected complex and rich enough for an interesting investigation?  Why?

    The data set contains more than 16000 licensing applications, mostly for
    premises and events.  As each application stores the exact location of its
    premise, we could analyze the development of different parts of Camden by
    looking at what types of businesses are being run there.  One could also
    examine features of the approval process, such as its duration, depending
    on the kind of the application and the region. This might also be
    interesting to analyze in a temporal contex, to see how the bureaucratic
    process evolves.
